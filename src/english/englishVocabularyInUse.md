### Aspects of higher academic study

- If a library does not have a copy of a book or journal, you may be able to access it online or you can usually get it through an inter-library loan. Open educational resources are paticularly convenient for many students.
- Academic study can be very demanding, and some students drop out, but the majority survive till finals and become well-qualified members of their future professions.
